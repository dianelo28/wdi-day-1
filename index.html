Interesting things from "How does the internet work":

1. Packets don't necessarily all take the same path - they generally travel the path of least resistance.

2. The version of IP most of us use today is IPv4, but we are running out of addresses, so in 1991, the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) decided back in 1991 that it was necessary to develop a new version of IP to create enough addresses to meet demand.  The resuly as IPv6, a 128 bit address system.

3. Aside from hardware, there is a second component of the internet: the protocols, the set of rules that machines follow to complete tasks.
